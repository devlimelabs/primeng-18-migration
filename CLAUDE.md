## Code Style Guidelines
- Use conventional commit messages: `refactor(primeng): [description of change]`
- Follow TypeScript best practices with proper typing
- Regular expressions carefully crafted to handle component/directive boundaries
- Keep whitespace and indentation consistent in the codebase
- Use comments to document complex migration operations or regex patterns
- Handle Git operations safely with error checking
- For UI interactions, always provide confirmation prompts before modifying files

## Major Migration Tasks
- Update PrimeNG module imports
- Rename component selectors (p-calendar â†’ p-datepicker, etc.)
- Replace deprecated directives/components
- Update CSS classes that have been renamed or removed
- Manage git operations (stashing, committing)
